        I like the way you explain the concept, you teach everything practically which make easy to learn language.
        And you never proceed unless I understand the concept clearly. In between you also give mini projects to
        complete which provide hands on experience. Thank you sir.

      <h4>Section 2: Server Side Development</h4>
      <p>
        In this section, you will find courses related to Server Side
        Development, including database and serverside concepts and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Server-side development is the process of creating software that
        runs on a server and responds to client requests over the internet.
        This type of development is essential for building web applications,
        mobile apps, and other networked software systems that require
        server-based processing and storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server-side development process typically involves several
        stages, including architecture design, programming, testing, and
        deployment. Developers use a variety of programming languages,
        frameworks, and tools to create server-side software, depending on
        the requirements of the project and the preferences of the
        development team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the most popular programming languages for server-side
        development include Java, Python, PHP, and JavaScript. These
        languages are widely used because they are easy to learn, have
        robust libraries and frameworks, and can handle complex tasks such
        as data processing, database management, and network communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Server-side development also involves working with databases, which
        are used to store and manage data for web applications. Popular
        database management systems (DBMS) for server-side development
        include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.
      </p>

    <section class="container">
      <h4>Section 2: API Development</h4>
      <p>
        REST, or Representational State Transfer, is a style of software
        architecture that is widely used in web development to create
        scalable, reliable, and easy-to-maintain web services. RESTful APIs,
        or Application Programming Interfaces, are a way of exposing the
        functionality of a web application to other developers, allowing
        them to interact with the application and use its functionality in
        their own applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        REST APIs are built on a set of architectural principles that
        promote simplicity, scalability, and modularity. The core principles
        of RESTful architecture include the use of standard HTTP methods
        such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources, the
        use of URIs to identify resources, and the use of hypermedia as a
        way of providing information about available resources and their
        relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing a RESTful API involves several stages, including
        designing the API, implementing the API, testing the API, and
        documenting the API. Developers typically use a framework such as
        Node.js, Express, Flask, or Django to implement RESTful APIs quickly
        and easily, and to ensure that the API conforms to RESTful
        architectural principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        RESTful APIs can be used for a wide range of purposes, including
        mobile app development, web development, and integrating different
        web applications. They are also popular for building microservices,
        which are small, modular, and loosely-coupled services that can be
        combined to create complex applications. RESTful APIs provide a
        standard way of accessing these services, making it easy for
        developers to build and integrate microservices into their own
        applications.
